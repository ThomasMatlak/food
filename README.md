## LICENSE
This project uses the AGPL license.
If you would like to use the project without the implications of AGPL, contact me for a commercial license.

The general, utility-type, code that I write will probably get spun off to a separate repository(s) with permissive (MIT?) licensing.
No, I will not provide a timeline for that happening.
