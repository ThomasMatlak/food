## LICENSE
I'm still deciding what license I want to use.
Ideally free for personal use, not so for commercial use.
e.g. run it locally, host it in the cloud, even have as many users as you want, as long as no money is coming your way for hosting it.
A dual-license setup seems to be the convention. One open, copy-left (aGPL?), and one commercial (??? Are there standard licenses for this?).

Until I decide on the licensing, you're welcome to have a look around, but keep your grubby paws off my code! (unlicensed software is NOT open software)

The general, utility-type, code that I write will probably get spun off to a separate repository(s) with permissive (MIT?) licensing.
No, I will not provide a timeline for that happening.
